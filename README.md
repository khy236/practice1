# FOR SALE: Central Brooklyn
Central Brooklyn contains the greatest concentration of frequently sold or "flipped" properties in NYC. Together, Bed-Stuy, Bushwick, Crown Heights, and Ocean Hill contain 28% of all NYC properties that were sold 5+ times over the last three decades (from 2003 to 2023).

This mask invites users to explore these flipped properties in greater detail and ask themselves: 
- What do they think is driving the frequency and prices at which they are sold? 
- What do they think these sales have meant for owners and residents in this area?
